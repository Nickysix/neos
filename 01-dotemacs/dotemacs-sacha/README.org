This is my personal config. It's really long, but that's partly
because I sometimes leave blog posts in it as commentary. (And also
because I've got a lot of little customizations that I might not even
remember. =) ). If you want to see a table of contents and other
useful niceties, go to http://sachachua.com/dotemacs . Other links for
