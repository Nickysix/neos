;; Ex. 197:
;; Design most-frequent. The function consumes a Dictionary and produces the
;; Letter-Count for the letter that is most frequently used as the first one
;; in the words of the given Dictionary.

;; What is the most frequently used letter in your computer’s dictionary and
;; how often is it used?

;; Note on Design Choices This exercise calls for the composition of the
;; solution to the preceding exercise with a function that picks the correct
;; pairing of a letter with a count. There are two ways to design this function:

;    Design a function that picks the pair with the maximum count.
;    (use max)

;    Design a function that selects the first from a list of pairs.
;   (use  first (sort)) ??

;; Consider designing both. Which one do you prefer? Why?
