* org-sidebar

This package presents a helpful sidebar view for Org buffers.  At the top is a chronological list of scheduled and deadlined tasks in the current buffer (similar to the Org agenda ,but without all its features), and below that is a list of all other non-done to-do items.  If the buffer is narrowed, the sidebar only shows items in the narrowed portion; this allows seeing an overview of tasks in a subtree.

Please note: this package is in an early stage of development, so incompatible changes may be made in the future.  However, it's stable and usable now.  Feedback is appreciated.

** Installation

Install these packages (e.g. from MELPA):

+  =dash=
+  =s= 

=org-ql= and =org-ql-agenda= are also required; they are not on MELPA, but may be found at [[http://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql]].  Put them and this file in your =load-path=.

** Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

Load the package with =(require 'org-sidebar)= (or use ~use-package~).  Then call the commands below.

Customization options are in the =org-sidebar= group.

*** Key bindings

In a sidebar buffer, these keys are bound:

+  =RET=, =mouse-1= :: Jump to an item in its buffer.
+  =g= :: Update the sidebar.
+  =q= :: Hide the sidebar.

*** Commands

+  ~org-sidebar~ :: ~(&key BUFFERS FNS STRUCTS GROUP SUPER-GROUPS)~ Display the Org Sidebar.
   
   Interactively, display the sidebars configured in ~org-sidebar-default-fns~.
   
   ~BUFFERS~ may be one or a list of buffers to display in the sidebar.
   
   ~FNS~ may be one or a list of functions, each of which may return a buffer or a ~org-sidebar~ struct.

   ~SIDEBARS~ may be one or a list of ~org-sidebar~ structs.
   
   When ~GROUP~ is non-nil (interactively, with one universal prefix argument), and when ~SUPER-GROUPS~ is nil, call each function with the ~group~ keyword argument non-nil.
   
   ~SUPER-GROUPS~ may be a list of groups according to ~org-super-agenda-groups~, in which case the items in the buffers will be grouped accordingly (where applicable).  Interactively, with two universal prefix arguments, the global value of ~org-super-agenda-groups~ is used.
+  ~org-sidebar-ql~ :: ~(&key QUERY BUFFERS-FILES NARROW GROUP-PROPERTY SORT)~ Display a sidebar for ~org-ql~ ~QUERY~.  Interactively, with prefix, prompt for these variables:
   
   ~BUFFERS-FILES~: ~A~ list of buffers and/or files to search.
   
   ~NARROW~: When non-nil, donâ€™t widen buffers before searching.
   
   ~GROUP-PROPERTY~: One of the following symbols: ~category~, ~parent~, ~priority~, ~todo~.
   
   ~SORT~: One or a list of ~org-ql~ sorting functions, like ~date~ or ~priority~.
+  ~org-sidebar-update~ :: Update current sidebar buffer.
