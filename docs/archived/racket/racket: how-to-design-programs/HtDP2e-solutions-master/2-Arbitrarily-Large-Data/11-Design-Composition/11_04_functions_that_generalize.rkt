;; Sample Problem Design a function that adds a polygon to a given scene.

;; A polygon is a planar figure with at least three points connected by
;; three straight sides.

; in 2htdp/image a polygon could be represented by a List-of-Posn, with at
; least 3 Posn's

; this definition works better with rest of book's example

    (make-posn 20 10)
    (make-posn 20 20)

; NELop -> Posn
; extracts the last item from p
;(define (last p)
;  (first p))

; Q: Why is it acceptable to use first for the stub definition of last?
; A: last take an NELop as a parameters so there is atleas on item
; on the list.  It is really the answer to the base casee question.

;; Ex 192:
;; Argue why it is acceptable to use last on Polygons. Also argue why
;; you may adapt the template for connect-dots to last:
#;
(define (last p)
  (cond
    [(empty? (rest p)) (... (first p) ...)]
    [else (... (first p) ... (last (rest p)) ...)]))

;; Finally, develop examples for last, turn them into tests, and ensure that
;; the definition of last in figure 69 works on your examples.

; A: that template is acceptable base for 'last' becuase it is a template
; for at least on item on a list.  You don't want to call last on an
; empty list.

; examples:
;(check-expect (last (list "a")) "a")  ; the base case
(check-expect (last triangle-p) (make-posn 30 10))
(check-expect (last square-p) (make-posn 10 20))
#; ; my defintion
(define (last p)
  (cond
    [(empty? (rest p)) (first p)]
    [else (last (rest p))]))

; the books defintion:
(define (last p)
  (cond
    [(empty? (rest (rest (rest p)))) (third p)]
    [else (last (rest p))]))

;; Ex 193:
;; Here are two more ideas for defining render-poly:

;; a: render-poly could cons the last item of p onto p and then call
;; connect-dots.

;; b: render-poly could add the first item of p to the end of p via a version of
;; add-at-end that works on Polygons.
