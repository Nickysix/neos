;; Exercise 4.4.3.
;; Some credit card companies pay back a small portion of the charges a
;; customer makes over a year. One company returns
;; 1. .25% for the first $500 of charges,
;; 2. .50% for the next $1000 (that is, the portion between $500 and $1500),
;; 3. .75% for the next $1000 (that is, the portion between $1500 and $2500),
;; 4. and 1.0% for everything above $2500.
;; Thus, a customer who charges $400 a year receives $1.00, which is 0.25 · 1/100 · 400,
;; and one who charges $1,400 a year receives $5.75, which is 1.25 = 0.25 · 1/100 · 500 for the first $500
