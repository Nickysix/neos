Exercise 178. Explain why the template for editor-kh deals with "\t" and "\r" before it checks for strings of length 1.


Those "/t" and "/r" represent special key events such as hitting the tab key.

Although there are two characters (slash and a letter) in between the sets of quote marks, calling

  (string-length "\t")

returns a length of 1.

So, it makes sense to check for these special keys to ignore, before hitting the condition for other 1-length strings which will represent letter characters to display on the Editor.
