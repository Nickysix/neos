** Custom sidebar command

It's easy to define a custom sidebar command.  Here's an example that shows items in =org-agenda-files= that are not done and either have a deadline on or before today, or are scheduled for today.  The query (~(and ...~) uses [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-agenda-ng][org-ql]] to select items.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun my/org-sidebar ()
    "Display my Org Sidebar."
    (interactive)
    (org-sidebar
     :sidebars (make-org-sidebar
                :name "My Sidebar"
                :description "My sidebar items"
                :items (org-ql (org-agenda-files)
                         (and (not (done))
                              (or (deadline <=)
                                  (date = today)))
                         :action element-with-markers))))
#+END_SRC

** Grouping with =org-super-agenda=

=org-sidebar= also integrates with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]].  This command is like the previous one, but it groups items with =org-super-agenda= into several groups.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun my/org-today-sidebar ()
    "Show my Org Today Sidebar."
    (interactive)
    (org-sidebar
     :sidebars (make-org-sidebar
                :name "Today"
                :description "Today items"
                :items (org-ql (org-agenda-files)
                         (and (not (done))
                              (or (deadline <=)
                                  (scheduled <=)
                                  (date = today)))
                         :action element-with-markers)
                :super-groups '((:time-grid t)
                                (:name "Overdue" :scheduled past :deadline past)
                                (:name "Due today" :scheduled today :deadline today)
                                (:tag "bills")
                                (:priority "A")
                                (:name "Non-tasks"
                                       :todo nil)))))
#+END_SRC

This shows a sidebar like this:

      (my/org-today-sidebar)))
#+END_SRC
