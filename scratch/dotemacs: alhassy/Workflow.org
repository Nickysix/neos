* Why?

  A new way to work, a new habit, is difficult to form without reminder.
  Whence this brief cheat sheet to get me going on this GTD process.
  
* Overview of the day

#+latex: {\color{white} .}
  
*Start of the day*:  \hfill ~1 hour
  
  - Look at mail with ~M-x gnus~ and capture tasks indiscriminately /unless/ marked urgent.
    
  - Quickly review upcoming week in the agenda, ensuring you're working on the right stuff
    --shuffle if need be.
    
  - If there are many ~C~ tasks, reschedule without a second thought. Aim for ≤15 tasks.
    # - You've already provided consideration when assigning priorities.
  
  - Progress towards ~A~ tasks completion by documenting work completed.

  A /good day/ is doing /at least/ all of the most important and urgent tasks --the ~A~ tasks.

*End of the day*:
  - Journal about what was completed and what was not.
  - Process, schedule, and archive tasks.
 
| ~C-c c~             | Capture an idea quickly   |
| ~C-c a~             | Open agenda to see tasks  |
| ~C-c a t~           | Compile global todo list  |
| ~C-c a u~           | See unprocessed tasks     |
| ~C-c C-s~           | Schedule task             |
| ~C-c a c~           | See completed tasks       |
| ~C-c C-x C-s~       | Archive task              |
| ~(org-search-view)~ | Search todo's and archive |

*Throughout the day*:
When new tasks come up, enter them impulsively and indiscriminately.
Do not make any further scheduling or processing considerations.

* Progressing Towards Completion

:TaskStates:
+ A ~TODO~ task may be ~STARTED~ but we may have to be ~WAITING~ on others to
  reply to our queries and we may put a task ~ON_HOLD~ indefinitely or have a task
  ~CANCELLED~ before it's actually ~DONE~.
:End:
  
| /Can't manage what you don't know!/ |
| /Where does the time go?/           |
| /Log it & document it!/             |

# + Clock into a task, use an estimated effort, work, then clock-out noting
#  what was accomplished.

*Clock in* on a heading with ~I~, or in the subtree with ~C-c C-x C-i~.              

  - An org-timer for 25 minutes starts, in case the task is dreadful.
  
*Clock out* of a heading with ~O~, or in the subtree with ~C-c C-x C-o~.

   - When we clock-out, a note of what's accomplished is added to the task.
   - Even if little, the note motivates progress.
   - Continuous journaling is akin to literate programming
     \hfill ---no one wants to do it after the fact.

#+latex: {\color{white} .}

Other ideas to assist in completing a task:

+ Add an arbitrary remark to a task with ~C-c C-z~.   
   
+ Move the state of a task with ~C-c C-t~.
  :More:
+  C-u [digit] C-c C-t :: Fast selection; no prefix argument forces cycling.
   - 1 TODO, 2 STARTED, 3 DONE, 4 WAITING, 5 ON_HOLD, 6 CANCELLED. 
+ ‘C-u t’ in an agenda buffer.
+ We can also change through states using Shift- left, or right.
:End:

+ Focus on a particular region when working to avoid being distracted.
  ~C-x n n/e/s/w~ for narrowing to region, org element or subtree, or widen.

+ From anywhere, ~C-u C-c C-x C-i~ yields a pop-up for recently clocked in tasks.

* Reflection; Journaling
# {{{no-vertical-padding(3.5)}}}
  
# | ~C-c j~ | org-journal-new-entry |
| ~C-c j~ | Discuss what's accomplished in journal  |
| ~C-c C-j~ | New entry into journal |
| ~C-c C-s~ | Search the journal |

- What was accomplished today?
  * See clocked times with ~C-c C-x C-r~.
- What are some notably bad habits? Good habits?
- What are some future steps?

* Processing Tasks

  Within the list of captured items, for each item we [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done#Workflow][do as follows]].
  
  0. Not actionable? Refile to trash, someday/maybe, or reference sections. 
  1. Multiple steps to completion? Make it into a project.
  2. Less than 2 minutes? Do it now.
  3. Is someone else supposed to do this? Delegate!
  4. If it has a specific date, schedule it; otherwise
     tag it with context needed to get it done.

* How to ‘Schedule’ a Task
    
  0. Provide an estimated time effort.
    
  1. On heading, press ~,~ then one of ~A, B, C~ to set its priority.
    
      | ~A~ | High urgency & important; rare.                  |
      | ~B~ | Moderate urgency & importance; most tasks.       |
      | ~C~ | Pretty much optional, or very quick or fun to do |
          
  2. Pick a date to get it done with ~C-c C-s~, then ~+n~ to have it be
     started ~n~ days from now.

    - Any time ≈ no time.
    -  Always schedule /then/ reschedule, if needed.

* Working with ‘Projects’

  If a task needs less than 2 minutes, do it immediately
  since the processing overhead is not worth it;
  otherwise, it's a ‘project’ and should be split up into multiple tasks.

  0. Append the project's name with ~[/]~ or ~[%]~ to get [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Checkboxes.html][progress statistics]].
     
  1. Produce a list of sub-tasks, in the form ~- [ ] subtask1~, that progress
     the project to completion.
     
  2. Test toggle a task into completion with ~C-c C-c~ on it, now the statistics
     are updated. If you manually toggle a task, use ~C-c #~ on the statistics
     to update them.

  At the top, for the project, add a single sentence description of a successful outcome,
  defining ‘done’ and clarifying the desired outcome.

# Describing the next action minimises procrastination as it makes it
# easier to decide what to do next. You don't need to make a decision
# of what to do every time you look at your list.
